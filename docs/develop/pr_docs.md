Any developer should follow next rules to create Pull Requests.
### Commits

Commit naming rules are presented [in this page](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format)

***

Each commit should have not much differences excluding cases, with:

  * CodeStyle changes;
  * Renames;
  * Code formating.

**Do atomic commits for each changes.** 
<pre>
refactor(class): correct indents before function params
refactor(class): rename vars according to codestyle
</pre>

**Don't mix codestyle changes and any logical fixes in one commit.**

***
